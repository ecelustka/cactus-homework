# Cactus homework

Create an application for recording a collection of cacti in any web framework.

For each plant, record its name, Latin name, pot size (small, medium, large) and number of spines (or an optional image).

It will be possible to display a list of all plants in the collection and filter it by part of the name, the size of the pot and the number of spines.

The application allows you to insert new cacti, delete existing ones and edit all their parameters.

Store the data on the backend (it doesn't matter how, file, database, ...), but not in the browser.
